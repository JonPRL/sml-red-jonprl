// Here are some cool examples of using RedPRL's generic and hypothetical judgment to reason
// semi-externally.

// We can prove the following path composition theorem for any arbitrary type #A; this 'thm'
// declaration elaborates to a definition Hcom/Poly{a:hyp}(#A:exp), so when you want to use 
// this as a lemma, you simply supply to the operator the appropriate hypothesis in your context
// which witnesses that #A = #A type. We could add a generic tactic that applies a lemma and 
// *asserts* all its hypotheses, or tries to unify these with the context, etc.
