### What is RedPRL?

*RedPRL* is the People's Refinement Logic, a next-generation homage
to [Nuprl](http://www.nuprl.org); RedPRL was preceeded by
[JonPRL](http://www.github.com/jonsterling/jonprl), written by Jon Sterling,
Daniel Gratzer and Vincent Rahli.

The purpose of RedPRL is to provide a practical implementation of Computational
Cubical Type Theory in the Nuprl style, integrating modern advances in proof
refinement.

### Literature and background on RedPRL

RedPRL is (becoming) a proof assistant for Computational Cubical Type Theory, as
described by Angiuli, Favonia, and Harper in [Computational Higher Type Theory
III: Univalent Universes and Exact Equality](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01800).
The syntactic framework is inspired by second-order abstract syntax (relevant
names include Aczel, Martin-LÃ¶f, Fiore, Plotkin, Turi, Harper, and many others).

### What is this repository?

This is the repository for the nascent development of RedPRL. RedPRL is an
experiment which is constantly changing; we do not yet have strong
documentation, but we have an IRC channel on Freenode (#redprl) where we
encourage anyone to ask any question, no matter how silly it may seem.

### How do I build it?

First, fetch all submodules. If you are cloning for the first time, use

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:RedPRL/sml-redprl.git

If you have already cloned, then be sure to make sure all submodules are up to date,
as follows:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Next, make sure that you have the [MLton compiler](http://mlton.org/) for Standard
ML installed. Then, simply run

    ./script/mlton.sh

Then, a binary will be placed in `./bin/redprl`, which you may run as
follows

    ./bin/redprl example/README.prl

### Editor Support: Vim

Our best-supported editor is currently Vim.
See the RedPRL plugin under [vim/](vim/).
